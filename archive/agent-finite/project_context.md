# Gemini Ad Campaign - Project Context

## Project Overview
This project generates high-quality, single-page website advertisements for Google Gemini AI, designed to compete against Perplexity, ChatGPT, and Claude. All pages must be hostable on GitHub Pages (static HTML, CSS, JavaScript only).

## Business Objectives
- Create 10+ distinct, compelling single-page ads to test across different user cohorts
- Capture users with short attention spans through best-in-class design and messaging
- Convert users who trust Google but haven't made Gemini their daily AI tool
- Highlight Gemini's unique advantages: Google Workspace integration, trustworthy citations, anti-hallucination features

## Target Audience Segments

Based on pre-survey data, we have four primary segments:

### 1. Writers
- Need: Content creation, editing assistance, writing tools
- Pain points: Writer's block, editing fatigue, research time
- Value prop: AI-powered writing companion with Google Docs integration

### 2. Creators
- Need: Ideation, brainstorming, content planning
- Pain points: Creative blocks, content planning, multi-format creation
- Value prop: Multimodal AI that understands images, generates ideas, creates content

### 3. Operators
- Need: Workflow automation, task management, productivity
- Pain points: Context switching, repetitive tasks, disorganized workflows
- Value prop: Seamless Google Workspace integration, automated workflows

### 4. Automators
- Need: Advanced integrations, API access, custom workflows
- Pain points: Manual processes, lack of integration, efficiency gaps
- Value prop: Deep workspace integration, automated data processing

## Design Philosophy

### Apple.com-Inspired Aesthetics
- **Minimalism**: Clean layouts, generous whitespace, focused messaging
- **Typography**: Elegant sans-serif fonts (SF Pro, Google Sans), clear hierarchy
- **Animations**: Smooth, purposeful transitions; scroll-triggered reveals
- **Color**: Restrained palette with strategic accent colors
- **Imagery**: Hero visuals, product-focused photography, atmospheric backgrounds
- **Spacing**: Consistent rhythm, breathing room, visual balance

### Key Design Principles
1. **Elegance First**: Every page must feel premium and polished
2. **Short Attention Span**: Hook users in 3 seconds, clear CTAs above fold
3. **Trust Signals**: Leverage Google brand equity, show citations/sources
4. **Dynamic > Static**: Use animations, micro-interactions, visual interest
5. **Mobile-First**: Perfect rendering on all devices
6. **Performance**: Fast loading, optimized assets, smooth scrolling
