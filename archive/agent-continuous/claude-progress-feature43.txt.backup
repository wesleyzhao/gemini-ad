================================================================================
TEST HYPOTHESES
================================================================================

1. TRUST - Competitive Positioning
   Hypothesis: Direct competitor comparison > abstract features
   Rationale: Users comparing tools want side-by-side comparisons
   Expected: +15-20% (HIGH confidence)

2. WRITERS - Outcome Focus
   Hypothesis: Finished work showcase > feature descriptions
   Rationale: Writers care about completion, not just capabilities
   Expected: +18-25% (HIGH confidence)

3. CREATORS - Design Minimalism
   Hypothesis: Apple-style minimal > rich colorful design
   Rationale: Simplicity reduces friction, increases conversions
   Expected: +10-15% (MEDIUM confidence)

4. OPERATORS - Time Savings
   Hypothesis: Specific ROI ($46K/year) > vague "efficiency"
   Rationale: Managers need concrete numbers to justify purchases
   Expected: +20-30% (VERY HIGH confidence - strongest test)
