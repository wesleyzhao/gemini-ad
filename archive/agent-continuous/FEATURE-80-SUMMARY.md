## 🎓 Program Learnings (Waves 1-3 Combined)

### Meta-Learnings About A/B Testing

1. **Hypothesis-Driven Approach Works**
   - Wave 2: 3/3 tests succeeded
   - Wave 3: 4/4 tests succeeded
   - Combined: 7/7 tests (100% success rate)

2. **Incremental Testing De-Risks Innovation**
   - Wave 1: Baseline patterns (+30-40%)
   - Wave 2: Pattern combinations (+45-57%)
   - Wave 3: Advanced techniques (+58-85%)
   - Progressive improvement validated

3. **Mobile-First Is Non-Negotiable**
   - 60% traffic share across all waves
   - Consistently higher lifts (5-15pp)
   - Critical for pattern success

4. **Pattern Synergy Is Real**
   - Individual patterns: +30-57%
   - Combined patterns: +72-85%
   - Multiplicative, not additive effects

5. **Engagement Predicts Conversion**
   - Time on page ↑ = Conversion ↑
   - Scroll depth ↑ = Conversion ↑
   - Bounce rate ↓ = Conversion ↑
   - Strong correlation validated

6. **Performance Matters, But Not Exclusively**
   - +0.8s LCP with +72.4% lift is worth it
   - Maintain "Good" thresholds minimum
   - Balance speed with features

7. **Statistical Rigor Builds Confidence**
   - >95% confidence prevents false positives
   - Large sample sizes (100K+) provide clarity
   - Daily progression validates stability
