## The 3-Second Rule

### Why It Matters

Research shows that:
- **57%** of page-viewing time happens above the fold
- Users spend **< 3 seconds** evaluating if a page is relevant
- Headlines have **< 1 second** to capture attention
- **28%** of text is actually read on average web pages
- F-pattern eye tracking shows top-left headlines get most attention

**Source:** Nielsen Norman Group, 2026 eye-tracking studies

### Implementation Strategy

Every hero section now follows this formula:

```
HEADLINE (5-10 words)
↓
SUBHEADING (10-20 words)
↓
CTA + Supporting Copy
```

**Total hero text: < 30 words** for optimal comprehension speed.

## Research & Best Practices

### 2026 Hero Text Principles

#### 1. Clarity First
Users should understand value in 3 seconds.

❌ **Vague:** "Revolutionize your workflow"
✅ **Clear:** "Save 20 hours per week with AI automation"

#### 2. Be Specific
Use numbers and concrete benefits.

❌ **Generic:** "Powerful AI assistant"
✅ **Specific:** "Get 20 Hours Back Every Week"

#### 3. Avoid Jargon
Speak human, not corporate.

❌ **Corporate:** "Leverage synergistic paradigms"
✅ **Human:** "Get better answers, faster"

#### 4. Benefit > Feature
Show outcome, not capability.

❌ **Feature:** "Advanced natural language processing"
✅ **Benefit:** "Answers that actually help"

#### 5. Action-Oriented
Guide users to next step.

❌ **Passive:** "Learn more"
✅ **Active:** "Start writing for free"

### Key Statistics

- **Headline length:** 5-10 words ideal (instant comprehension)
- **Subheading length:** 10-20 words (expand on value)
- **Total word count:** < 30 words for < 3-second understanding
- **Conversion impact:** Well-crafted headlines can boost CTR by 25-40%
