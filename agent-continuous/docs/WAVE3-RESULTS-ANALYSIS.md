### Why It Met But Didn't Exceed Prediction (+60.3% vs +65%)

While still a strong success, Interactive Demos came in 4.7 percentage points below prediction. Analysis reveals:

1. **Mobile Complexity:** Some demos (especially Workspace Integration and Code Generation) were complex for mobile users, leading to 38-42% mobile completion rates vs 45-48% desktop.

2. **Learning Curve:** Research Assistant and Workspace demos required more cognitive effort, resulting in lower interaction rates (54-56% vs 58-62% for simpler demos).

3. **Demo Loading Time:** +0.3s LCP and +15ms FID (vs video test) may have caused some impatient users to bounce before demos fully loaded.

4. **Conservative Prediction:** Our +65% prediction assumed 60% interaction rate, but we achieved 57.8% - still excellent but slightly below target.

**However:** The test still exceeded our minimum success threshold (+50%) by 10.3pp and achieved 99.6% statistical confidence, making it a clear winner for scaling.

- Can test 10+ pattern combinations simultaneously
- Automatically allocates more traffic to winning variants

**Test Design:**
- **Target Pages:** All 20 pages
- **Control:** Best static patterns (Wave 3 winners)
- **Variant:** AI algorithm selecting optimal patterns per user
- **Traffic Split:** 30/70 (control/variant - give algorithm more data)
- **Duration:** 30 days (continuous learning)

**Algorithm Features:**
1. Test 15+ pattern combinations simultaneously
2. Adjust traffic allocation every hour based on performance
3. Segment-aware (different patterns for Writers vs Creators)
4. Time-aware (different patterns for morning vs evening)
5. Performance-aware (scale back patterns if Core Web Vitals degrade)

**Predicted Lift:** +80-100% (vs static +72%)
**Predicted Annual Revenue:** +$40-50M incremental
**Confidence:** Medium-High (proven technique, new to our stack)

### Test Concept 3: Predictive Intent Modeling

**Hypothesis:** AI that predicts user intent within 5 seconds and proactively shows relevant content (before user scrolls/clicks) increases conversion by reducing cognitive load and friction.

**Rationale:**
- Users spend 3-8s deciding if page is relevant
- Predictive model can analyze behavior and show best content immediately
- Reduces time to conversion by 40-60%
- Builds on Wave 3 personalization success

**Test Design:**
- **Target Pages:** research.html, comparison.html, trust.html (high-intent pages)
- **Control:** Standard personalization (Wave 3)
- **Variant:** Predictive intent model
- **Traffic Split:** 50/50
- **Duration:** 14 days

**Intent Signals:**
1. Scroll velocity (fast = skimming, slow = reading)
2. Mouse movement (hovering = interest)
3. Click patterns (CTA clicks vs nav clicks)
4. Time on page (< 10s = bounce risk, > 30s = engaged)
5. Referral source (Google = high intent, social = browsing)

**Predictive Actions:**
1. **High Intent (60%):** Show CTA immediately with personalized offer
2. **Medium Intent (30%):** Show social proof and demo offer
3. **Low Intent (10%):** Show engaging video to capture attention

**Predicted Lift:** +70-90%
**Predicted Annual Revenue:** +$30-40M
**Confidence:** Medium (requires AI/ML development)

### Test Concept 4: Voice + AR Integration

**Hypothesis:** Voice search within pages and AR product visualizations create cutting-edge experiences that differentiate product and drive +60-80% conversion lift.

- **Traffic Split:** 50/50
- **Duration:** 14 days

**Features:**
1. **Voice Search:** "What can Claude do for video editing?"
2. **Voice Commands:** "Show me pricing" / "Start demo"
3. **AR Workspace:** Visualize Claude in your actual workspace (mobile AR)
4. **AR Interface:** See chat interface overlaid on your desktop (desktop AR)

**Predicted Lift:** +60-80%
**Predicted Annual Revenue:** +$25-35M (if scaled to 5 premium pages)
**Confidence:** Low-Medium (experimental, dependent on browser support)

### Test Concept 5: Community Social Proof

**Hypothesis:** Real-time, dynamic social proof (live user count, activity feed, public Q&A) is more compelling than static testimonials and drives +55-75% lift.

**Rationale:**
- Static social proof becomes stale
- Live activity creates FOMO and urgency
- Community Q&A builds trust through transparency
- Users trust peer experiences > marketing messages

**Test Design:**
- **Target Pages:** All pages with social proof elements (15+ pages)
- **Control:** Static social proof (Wave 2/3)
- **Variant:** Live community social proof
- **Traffic Split:** 50/50
- **Duration:** 14 days

**Live Social Proof Elements:**
